                <p>Ok, so my name isn't Jane but I <span class="underline">am</span> learning (again) to garden.  Container Garden, that is.
                    Why container gardening, you ask?
                    I decided that, much like the George Straight song &#34Here for a Good Time&#34,
                    I want to <strong>DO</strong> rather than just dream about what I'd like to do.
                    So what does that have to do with container gardening?  Who dreams of container gardening?
                    One word:  Hawaii!!!</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Huh?  Hawaii?  Yep.  So here's the thing... I want to live on an island.
                    It doesn't have to be Hawaii, there are several that would work.
                     But island life isn't all &#34island time&#34 and beaches. Island life brings the added
                     challenge of expensive goods due to limited natural resources and high freight costs for anything that is shipped in.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>One way that islanders can beat the high cost of living is by growing their own produce.
                    Not surprisingly, however, land is at a premium so vertical and container gardening is the way to go.
                    Enter <strong>PHASE 1</strong> in preparing to live the dream:  learning to container garden.</p>

                <h1>My Progress</h1>
                <p class="p-inline">Where I started...</p>
                <img id="dead-plant" src="images/deadplant.jpg" />
                <p>That's right, I could kill anything through neglect.  (I'm fairly certain that my kids only lived because they were noisy when they were hungry.)  BUT, I grew gardens full of vegetables and flowers from seed when I was a kid so I knew I could do it again.</p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Year One</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>The first year actually somewhat by coincidence when I found some small wooden boxes at the Habitat Restore.  The manager commented
                    that his wife wanted to use them as garden boxes and he would give me a deal if he didn't have to take them ALL home.  Well, far be
                    it from me to pass up a deal!  So I took the boxes, went to the nursery to buy plants, and I was hooked.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I went into &#34research mode&#34, learning which plants would grow best in containers, the optimal soil mixture, and planting timelines.
                    By the end of May, I had filled our patio with pots and convinced my husband to build a 4 foot by 8 foot raised bed.  I had a lot of
                    failures, from buying cheap potting soil that set up to a concrete-like state to not providing adequate drainage resulting in root rot.
                    But I had some success too.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="p-inline">  Here is a picture of my first harvested zucchini:</p>
                <img id="zucchini" src="images/zucchini.jpg" />
                <br/>
                <p class="p-inline">And here is a view of my raised bed during that first summer:</p>
                <img id="raised-bed" src="images/squashplants.jpg" />
                <p>For a while that first summer, we had more squash and zucchini than we could eat until the garden succumbed to neglect while I was away on a business trip.</p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Year Two and Beyond</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>The second year was a furthering of the experiment and learning process.  I went into the season with a full plan and a bit of confidence.
                    What I didn't take into consideration; however, is that with this soil having been planted in before,
                    there would be pests introduced/established that I hadn't had to deal with the first year.  But every failure is a great learning opportunity
                    and here are a few things I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Those things that look like stink bugs are actually squash bugs.  KILL THEM!</li>
                    <li>Move the tomato plants each year because hornworms are disgusting creatures.</li>
                    <li>Business trips are BAAADDDD for my garden.  Alas, the bugs demolished the whole thing in one week of my absence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This coming summer will be year three.  I'll apply the knowledge I've gained so far and see what new challenges crop up.</p>
